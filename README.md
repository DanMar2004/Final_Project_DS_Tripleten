# Final_Project_DS_Tripleten
## Classifier model to predict the customer chrun of the telecomunication company Interconnect

In this project we have 4 CSV files with important information about the clients, contracts and services. Also information about current clients and those who stopped using the services.

## Target
Create an ML model to predict the chrun, evaluting using AUC-ROC metric aiming for a score over .85

## Results
* After evaluating all of the models the best was neural network, almost all of models had similar results like random forest, XGBoost.
* Indentication of the feautures that have the strongest relation to chrun
* Optimizing the resource of each model
